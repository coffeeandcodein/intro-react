# No, seriously, the code is here (or, how to use this repository)

In the several branches of this repo, named for sections in the course, you will find code that goes with those sections. Check out the branch to use the code. 

Be aware that the React Native app in chapter 6:
* has been greatly expanded from what's in the video; 
* is not a web app! It's a full-fledged native mobile app for iOS, so if you just sail in from chapter 5 and expect it to work the same, that speed bump might hurt;
* was written before React Native supported Android, so won't run unless you're on a Mac (with Xcode installed). Making it run on Android would be a fun exercise, probably not too strenuous.

Have fun, everybody! - Mike
